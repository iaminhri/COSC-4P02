## Project Summary  

### Our Goal  
Our goal is to develop a user-friendly website that will have a user profile and dashboard.  
It will also enable users to input a list of news and social media sources, topics, keywords, locations, or industries to generate personalized newsletters and social media content using advanced AI techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The content will be formatted for various platforms, including:
- Email newsletters  
- Twitter posts  
- LinkedIn updates  
- Instagram captions  

This ensures both relevance and platform compatibility. Additionally, users will receive automated notifications at intervals they specify.

### Objectives

- Provide users with highly relevant and tailored content.
- Offer Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to enable seamless interaction and personalized content delivery.
- Share generated content with other media platforms.
