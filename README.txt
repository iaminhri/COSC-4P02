<h2>Project Summary: </h2><br>
<h1>Our Goal</h1>
    <p>
        Our goal is to develop a user-friendly website that will have a user profile and dashboard. 
        It will also enable users to input a list of news and social media sources, topics, keywords, 
        locations, or industries to generate personalized newsletters and social media content using 
        advanced AI techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP).
    </p>
    <p>
        The content will be formatted for various platforms, including email newsletters, Twitter posts, 
        LinkedIn updates, and Instagram captions, ensuring both relevance and platform compatibility. 
        Additionally, users will receive automated notifications at intervals they specify.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our platform aims to save time and provide users with highly relevant and tailored content 
        by automating content aggregation, summarization, and delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, we will develop software as a service that will provide users with a friendly 
        environment to interact and receive personalized generated content in the proper format. 
        We will also be able to share the news with other media platforms.
    </p>
